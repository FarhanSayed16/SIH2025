# 🔑 Device Token Setup - COMPLETE!

**Date:** December 8, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **DEVICE REGISTERED**

---

## ✅ **DEVICE REGISTRATION COMPLETE**

Your device has been successfully registered in the backend!

**Device Details:**
- **Device ID:** `KAV-NODE-001`
- **Device Name:** `Safety Node 001`
- **Device Type:** `multi-sensor`
- **Institution:** Delhi Public School
- **Room:** Lab
- **Status:** Active

**Device Token:**
```
YOUR_DEVICE_TOKEN_FROM_REGISTER_SCRIPT
```

---

## 🔧 **OPTION 1: Automatic Token Storage (Recommended)**

The ESP32 code will automatically store the token after first successful connection. However, since registration requires authentication, you have two options:

### **Option A: Set Token Manually (Quick Test)**

1. Open `arduino/esp_code_integrated.ino`
2. Find this section (around line 270):
```cpp
// Phase 201: Manual token entry for testing (if device pre-registered)
// Uncomment and set token if device was registered via admin/script
// deviceToken = "YOUR_DEVICE_TOKEN"; // Pre-registered token
```

3. Uncomment and update:
```cpp
deviceToken = "YOUR_DEVICE_TOKEN"; // Pre-registered token
if (deviceToken.length() > 0) {
  preferences.begin("kavach", false);
  preferences.putString("deviceToken", deviceToken);
  preferences.end();
  Serial.println("✅ Using pre-registered token.");
  return true;
}
```

4. Upload code to ESP32
5. Token will be stored automatically
6. You can comment it out again after first run

### **Option B: Skip Registration (Device Already Exists)**

The ESP32 will try to register, fail (401), but that's OK. The device already exists. You just need to set the token manually as in Option A.

## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Set the token in code** (Option A above)
2. **Upload to ESP32**
3. **Restart ESP32**
4. **Watch Serial Monitor**

**Expected Output:**
```
--- KAVACH SYSTEM BOOTING ---
Initializing Sensors... ✅ MPU6050 Connected.
Connecting to Wi-Fi: YOUR_WIFI_SSID
✅ Wi-Fi Connected!
✅ Using pre-registered token.
✅ System Ready. Monitoring Environment...
✅ Telemetry sent successfully
```

---

## ✅ **SUCCESS INDICATORS**

You'll know it's working when you see:
- ✅ `Telemetry sent successfully` (every 10 seconds)
- ✅ No "No device token" errors
- ✅ Alerts sent when sensors trigger
- ✅ Device appears in admin dashboard

---

## 🔍 **VERIFY IN BACKEND**

1. Check admin dashboard → Devices
2. Verify `KAV-NODE-001` appears
3. Check telemetry is being received
4. Test alerts are created

---

**Status:** ✅ **DEVICE READY - SET TOKEN AND UPLOAD!**
