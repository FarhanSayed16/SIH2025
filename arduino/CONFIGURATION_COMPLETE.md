# ✅ ESP32 Configuration Complete

**Date:** December 8, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **CONFIGURED AND READY**

---

## 📝 **CONFIGURATION APPLIED**

### **Network Settings:**
- **Wi-Fi SSID:** `YOUR_WIFI_SSID`
- **Wi-Fi Password:** `YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD`
- **Backend URL:** `https://YOUR_TUNNEL_OR_HOST`

### **Device Settings:**
- ✅ **Device ID:** `KAV-NODE-001`
- ✅ **Device Name:** `Safety Node 001`
- ✅ **Institution ID:** `your-mongodb-institution-id` (Delhi Public School)
- ✅ **Room:** `Lab` (you can change this in code if needed)

---

## 🔧 **CHANGES MADE**

### **1. Network Configuration:**
```cpp
const char* WIFI_SSID = "YOUR_WIFI_SSID";
const char* WIFI_PASSWORD = "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD";
const char* BACKEND_URL = "https://YOUR_TUNNEL_OR_HOST";
```

### **2. Device Configuration:**
```cpp
const char* DEVICE_ID = "KAV-NODE-001";
const char* DEVICE_NAME = "Safety Node 001";
const char* INSTITUTION_ID = "your-mongodb-institution-id";
const char* ROOM = "Lab";
```

### **3. HTTPS Support:**
- ✅ Added `WiFiClientSecure` for HTTPS connections
- ✅ Added certificate validation skip for dev tunnels
- ✅ Updated all HTTP requests (registration, telemetry, alerts)

---

## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS**

### **1. Pre-Register Device (IMPORTANT):**

Since device registration requires admin authentication, you need to register the device first:

**Option A: Using Registration Script:**
```bash
cd backend
node scripts/register-iot-device.js KAV-NODE-001 "Safety Node 001" your-mongodb-institution-id "Lab"
```

**Option B: Using Admin Dashboard:**
1. Log into admin dashboard
2. Go to Devices → Register Device
3. Fill in:
   - Device ID: `KAV-NODE-001`
   - Device Name: `Safety Node 001`
   - Device Type: `multi-sensor`
   - Institution: Delhi Public School
   - Room: `Lab`
4. Copy the device token (you'll need it if registration fails)

### **2. Upload Code:**
1. Open `arduino/esp_code_integrated.ino` in Arduino IDE
2. Verify code compiles (should work now)
3. Upload to ESP32
4. Open Serial Monitor (115200 baud)

### **3. Monitor Output:**
Expected output:
```
--- KAVACH SYSTEM BOOTING ---
Initializing Sensors... ✅ MPU6050 Connected.
✅ MPU6050 Connected.
Connecting to Wi-Fi: YOUR_WIFI_SSID
✅ Wi-Fi Connected!

Registering device with backend...
✅ Device registered successfully!
Token: abc123...
✅ System Ready. Monitoring Environment...

## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT NOTES**

### **HTTPS Support:**
- Code now handles HTTPS connections
- Certificate validation is skipped for dev tunnels (development only)
- For production, you should add proper certificate validation

### **Device Registration:**
- If registration fails with 401 error, device needs to be pre-registered
- Use the registration script or admin dashboard
- Token will be stored automatically after successful registration

### **Device ID:**
- Current device ID: `KAV-NODE-001`
- If you need multiple devices, change this to `KAV-NODE-002`, `KAV-NODE-003`, etc.
- Each device needs a unique ID

## 🧪 **TESTING**

### **Test Sensors:**
1. **Fire:** Bring flame near sensor → Should see "🔥🔥 CRITICAL: FIRE DETECTED!"
2. **Flood:** Submerge water sensor → Should see "🌊 FLOOD ALERT!"
3. **Earthquake:** Shake device → Should see "⚠️ SHAKING DETECTED!"

### **Verify Backend:**
1. Check admin dashboard → Devices
2. Verify device appears
3. Check telemetry is being received
4. Test alerts are created

## ✅ **READY TO UPLOAD**

The code is now fully configured and ready to upload to your ESP32!

**File:** `arduino/esp_code_integrated.ino`

**Status:** ✅ **CONFIGURATION COMPLETE**  
**Next:** Upload code and test!
